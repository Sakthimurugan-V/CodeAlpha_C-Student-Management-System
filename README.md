# 🎓 Student Management System in C

A **Student Management System** built using the C programming language.  
This program allows users to **add, view, search, update, and delete** student records stored in a binary file (`students.dat`).  
It demonstrates the use of **structures, file handling, and menu-driven programming** in C.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Add Student** – Enter new student details (ID, Name, Age, Grade) and save to file  
📋 **Display Students** – View all stored student records  
🔍 **Search Student** – Find a student by their ID  
✏️ **Update Student** – Edit existing student details  
🗑️ **Delete Student** – Remove a student record permanently  
💾 **File Storage** – Data is stored in a binary file (`students.dat`) for persistence

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Structures (`struct`)**
- **File Handling** (`fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fseek`, `rename`, `remove`)
- **Functions and Modular Programming**
- **Loops & Switch Case**
- **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
